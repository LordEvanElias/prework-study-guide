# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

As a way to learn the technology that will be used in the NorthWestern Coding Bootcamp as well as a way to keep some notes on my learning, I created a webpage study guide using some of the technology that will be used in the Bootcamp. This included CSS, JavaScript, HTML, and Git. 

## Installation

N/A: It is a webpage.

## Usage

This study guide contains notes that are useful for those learning these languages mentioned in the description (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git). 

If you open the DevTools console, you can see JavaScript running. It will list the topics learned and choose one at random to start studying.
